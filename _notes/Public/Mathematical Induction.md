#math
Consists of 3 steps

# Induction Hypothesis
State the identity that we want to prove.

# Base case
Prove that the property is true for $n=1$.

# Inductive Step
show that if the property is true for $n$, then it must be true for $n+1$.

This works because the base case shows the property holds for $n=1$. Then we apply the inductive step to show that it holds for $n=2$, which implies that it holds for $n=3$, and so forth for all positive integers.
