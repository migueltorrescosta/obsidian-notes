# Equation
$$F_D = \frac{1}{2}C{\rho}Av^2$$
where
| Variable | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| $F_D$ i.e. $D_{Force}$ | $kg \times ms^-2$ | Drag Force ( $\neq$ Drag Factor ) |
| $C$ | $1$ | Drag coefficient |
| $A$ | $m^2$ | Area of the object facing the fluid |
| $\rho$ | $kg \times m^{-3}$ | Density of the fluid/gas |
| $v$ | $ms^{-1}$ | speed of the object | 

# FAQ

## How is the Drag Factor different from decelleration?
It is not different

## What impacts the Drag Coefficient?
The aerodynamics of the object all contribute to the Drag Coefficient. As such the Drag Coefficient tends to be calculated in practice by measurements of decellaration in the real world, or the usage of wind tunnels
