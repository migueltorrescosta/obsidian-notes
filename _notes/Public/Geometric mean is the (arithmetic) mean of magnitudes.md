For a set $A = \\{ x_1, x_2, ... ,x_n \\}$ of positive numbers, the arithmetic mean is defined as $\frac{1}{n} \sum {x_i}$ whereas the geometric mean is defined as $\sqrt[n]{ \prod x_i}$, resulting in:

| $A$ | Arithmetic Mean | Geometric Mean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\{ 4,9 \}$ | $6.5$ | $6$ |
| $\{ 1,2,4,8,16 \}$ | $6.2$ | $4$ |

The Geometric Mean becomes obvious if we write all numbers as magnitudes:

| $A$ | Arithmetic Mean | Geometric Mean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\{ 2^2,2^{3.1699}\}$ | $2^{2.7004}$ | $2^{2.58496}$ |
| $\{ 2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4\}$ | $2^{2.632268}$ | $2^2$ |

Note that $2.58496$ is just the Arithmetic Mean of $\{ 2 , 3.1699 \}$, and for the second line $2$ is the mean of $\{ 0,1,2,3,4 \}$. I have written them base $2$ but any magnitude would suffice.
