I have used this tool to access [my own Jupyter notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/migueltorrescosta/tutor/), such as
- A detailed description of [Phase Planes and their points of interest](https://colab.research.google.com/github/migueltorrescosta/tutor/blob/master/Phase_Planes.ipynb)
- A visual and simplistic introduction to [Bayseian Updating](https://colab.research.google.com/github/migueltorrescosta/tutor/blob/master/BayesianUpdating.ipynb)
- An [implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/migueltorrescosta/tutor/blob/master/ExpectedOpportunityLoss.ipynb) of the ideas behind the book [[How To Measure Anything]]
