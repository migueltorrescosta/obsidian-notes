[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/n00b-syntaxReference.html) is an declaritive way to write up diagrams, allowing us to easily and compactly version control them. Obsidian renders this diagrams well, but unfortunately the jekyll based website doesn't. yet.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
