This note contains a list of things that I want to do at some point. Reach out if you want to do any of these together.

# Kotlin App
Kotlin can be used to code both the server side and frontent, and provides a lot of benefits due to it's static typing nature.

# Poetry
Build a Python package with poetry for verisoning handling. I should know how to do this by now.
