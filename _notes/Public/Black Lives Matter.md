# Testimony

## quotes from a [Vox article](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8661977/race-police-officer)

>The effect of institutional racism is such that no matter what color the officer abusing the citizen is, in the vast majority of those cases of abuse that citizen will be black or brown. That is what is allowed.

> Judge John O’Donnell acquitted Brelo under the rationale that because he couldn’t determine which shots actually killed Russell and Williams, no one is guilty. Let’s be clear: this is part of what the Department of Justice means when it describes a [“pattern of unconstitutional policing and excessive force.”](http://nytimes.com/2015/05/26/us/cleveland-police.html)
