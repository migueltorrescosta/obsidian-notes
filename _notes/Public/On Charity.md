There is a lot of [[Fund Raising]] campaigns that work on the basis of helping with recent catastrophes, such as [[Cyclone Freddie]] ( [npr news article](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/14/1163380089/cyclone-freddy-malawi-mozambique-flooding-mudslides) ).

This feels like an inneficient way of making the most of our donations, given that

- Each individual is making the same decision of where best to donate their money.
- We get impacted by emotional appeals more than the impact of the donation.
- There is a huge coordination problem where strong campaigns such as the ones lead by the [[June 2017 Portugal wildfires]] lead to more money being donated than needed.

# Better alternative

Donate a percentage of our monthly income to a group that maximises the impact of our donations. I believe this work is being done by [[Effective Altruism]] ( their [homepage](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) ).
