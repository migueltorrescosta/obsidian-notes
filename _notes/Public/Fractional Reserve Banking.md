> System of [banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank "Bank") operating in almost all countries worldwide, under which banks that take [deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_deposits "Bank deposits") from the public are required to hold a proportion of their [deposit liabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting) "Liability (financial accounting)") in liquid assets as a reserve, and are at liberty to lend the remainder to borrowers.

It allows Banks to make more profits, however it exposes them to possible [[Bankruptcy]] triggered by a [[Bank Run]].
