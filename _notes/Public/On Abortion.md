Applying the idea's of [[Joshua Green]] on [[Moral Tribes]], we see two options

1. Pro-life: parents can decide to have an abortion
2. Pro-choice: parents have to see pregnancies all the way through

Bypassing idealisms / feelings of attachment to Freedom for those pro-choice, or Life for those pro-choice, the goal is to see what is best.

Sources need to be added, but my current belief is that a pro-life world ends in nefarious situations, since parents considering abortion

- Don't seek help in order not to be found pregnant
- Still seek abortion mechanisms, which are often primitive and unsafe in their nature
- Medical complications from improvised abortions worsens the burden on healthcare systems

I'd be happy to be presented with points on the opposite direction
