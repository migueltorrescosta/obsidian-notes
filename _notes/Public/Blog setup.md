## This webpage was setup using the following tools
- [Jekyll Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io)
	- Pretty but graphless
	- Contains an amazing search bar
	- [Preview template](https://hiran.in/)
- [Digital Garden Setup](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)
	- Simple layout.
	- The `notes_graph.json` needs to be generated locally, which we might be able to do easily with `pre-push` hooks.
	- [Preview template](https://digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app/your-first-note)
- [Jekyll's Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/)

## Want to have
- [ ] Broken Link checker on the live page
- [ ] ( Maybe ) Include the graph view on the website 
	- [ ] Potential approach: Write a script to generate the `notes_graph.json` file needed for rendering the local graph.
