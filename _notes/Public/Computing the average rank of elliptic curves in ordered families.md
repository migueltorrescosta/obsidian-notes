An [[Elliptic Curve]] $E$ is the set of points $(x, y)$ satisfying an equation of the form $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$, together with a special point “at infinity”. When the coefficients $a$, $b$ are rational numbers, it is of interest to study the set of all rational points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation. It turns out that the rational points on $E$ form a finitely generated [[Abelian Group]], and an important invariant attached to $E$ is the [[Rank]] of this [[Group]].

During the project we explored the “average” rank of various [[Elliptic Curves]] in certain families by using [[Sage]] to build a database of millions of elliptic curves, then computing various important number theoretic invariants attached to these curves.
