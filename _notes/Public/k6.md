k6 is a tool by [[Grafana]] that allows us to quickly replicate a sequence of HTTP requests through a website. This facilitates performance testing.

# Requirements
- [har-to-k6](https://k6.io/docs/test-authoring/recording-a-session/har-converter/) converter, a [[NodeJS]] tool
- Setup yourself to [run k6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/running-k6/). The docker version is quicker to setup, the local version allows you to make use of local files more easily

# Replicating the processes
- Record the sequence of HTTP steps you're interested in into an [HAR File](https://help.okta.com/oag/en-us/Content/Topics/Access-Gateway/troubleshooting-with-har.htm)
- Download the file
- Convert it into a [[JavaScript]] script using the `har-to-k6 <har_file> -o <output-file>`
- [run k6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/running-k6/) via the CLI or Docker
	- Docker command : `docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <script.js`
