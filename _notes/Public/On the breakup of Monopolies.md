From a pure Survival of the fittest viewpoint, smaller interconnected companies should be more productive than monoliths. Why? Because monoliths are slower to adapt ( See all the new tech startups beating the giants ), and smaller companies can "replace parts" fast and efficiently. However giants still have a high survival rate. [[Google]] has proved it with [[Gmail]], [[Google Calendar]], [[Google Docs]]. They are all different services that don't overlap in requirements, and as such there is no need for them to fall under the same umbrella company.

I believe there are 2 main reasons for this:

1. [[Branding]] is powerful in selling new services: anything Google creates will be tried by a solid fanbase, however this does not apply to a [[Startup]] nobody heard of.
2. Friction: negotiating prices between small companies creates friction, which does not exist when a company provides all the parts.

Point 2 seems harder to address: pricing is a tough problem in any [[Illiquid Market]]. Point 1 could be solved though: could branding be provided to small companies? It feels like this is already, partially, being done by the likes of [[TechCrunch]] and VC companies
