For [[Web Development]], there are different places where websites have information store

# Browser cache
WIP

# Session storage
Stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed

# Local Storage
`localStorage` is a way to store data on the clientâ€™s computer. It allows the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript, and HTML5.

# Cookies
Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side .
