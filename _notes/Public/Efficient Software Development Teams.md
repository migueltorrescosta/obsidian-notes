# Requirements

## Documentation protocols
It must be clear where to add and look for documentation. 1:1 conversations / out-of-band meetings do not scale with team size.

## Clear Communication Channels
Clarity on where each bit of communication happens. This allows us to know where to get the information we need 

## Tracking work
Procedures on how work get's decided / where it can be seen / how it is prioritized provide confidence on how the team works.

## Product clarity
We need to know what we are building to. This provides essential guidance when making lower level decisions on what we are building

> Paved paths get you started in a known good state. But they donâ€™t prevent you from deviating from the path when the team deems it necessary
